# BIOS Boot

This project represents my personal effort to boot into a custom program on a x86 computer with Legacy Boot (BIOS). This is very much work in progress. Currently, only four operations are executed upon boot:
1. Load additional segments into memory
1. Change into 80x25 16-color text mode
1. Print "Hello World!"
1. Halt
